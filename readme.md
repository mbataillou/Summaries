# Summaries
This repository collects different summaries from the college list below:
- [Centrale Paris][5864f837]
- [UPC - Caminos][d27c36d4]
- [Dauphine][1ee6bdb2]
## Purpose
Some subjects lack of an appropriate teaching material or there is a way of complementing the available material in a useful way. This situations add an unintended difficulty to the understanding of the subjects. This project tries to tackle this problem by building a collaborative and concise database of notes and summaries.
## How to contribute
The main characteristic of this summaries is their time variability as they should evolve with the contribution of each promotion. This said, how do you contribute ?
### Case 1
If you know `latex` and `git` you should create a `pull request`.
### Case 2
In any other case you can send an email to summaries.git@gmail.com, detailing the exact correction (already written) you think I should do. You can also send a summary about another subject I haven’t already covered.
## Rules
For this project to work, it’s essential to be sure of the contents you send. I’m alone and it would be too time consuming for me to check them.
There’s no college restriction, it will be great if you add yours.
